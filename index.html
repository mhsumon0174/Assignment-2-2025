                        <p>Pre-primary education is usually divided in two stages: kindergarten/ nursery/playgroup for children of 3-5 years; and pre-primary or kindergarten for children aged 5-6 years. There is, however, another kind of arrangement in some schools: play group for children aged 3-4, nursery for 4-5, KG-1 for 5-6, and KG-2 for children aged 6-7.</p>

                    <p>The Curriculum in Elementary Level aims to develop a child’s moral, mental and physical capabilities. The curriculum focuses on basic learning tools in order to help to develop the students’ competencies. To achieve these objectives, our elementary education stresses the development of functional English as the basic tool for further learning.</p>
